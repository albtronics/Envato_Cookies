In the seminar, a brief introduction to the Printed Circuit Board was discussed. Its uses, requirements, different types of PCBs, basic PCB terminologies and its characteristics were presented. Then, the advancements of the different types of conductive ink and their features were highlighted. Finally, the most recent advancement in additively produced RF Structures on Low-Cost PCB materials based on Inkjet technology was discussed. Usually, the printed circuit board industry has to use special subtractive manufacturing methods, if small line and space dimensions down to 50 µm are desired. This drastically raises production effort and costs. Among, the paper presented for the seminar, a method is shown, how the inkjet technology can be used to produce passive RF structures with minimum line and space dimensions of 25 µm. For the first time, this is possible over complete panels of low-cost PCB substrates, which have a relatively high surface roughness compared to ceramic or glass carriers. To ensure process reliability, printed lines must also be plated with an additional electroless copper layer to overcome the surface roughness with conductive layers and to lower insertion loss in the two-digit GHz range. I had studied that, a surface impedance model is developed additionally, which allows broadband first time right simulations. Finally, additively produced, passive RF filters are compared to their subtractive counterparts to show their benefits regarding production costs and electrical performance up to 80 GHz.
